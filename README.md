# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains mini projects in machine learning with jupyter notebook files. The challange here was to goonline, find old code bases that were either never completed due to errors or they had been completed and they were old code bases to be updated. Some were from youtube courses i took online as code along and the rest were just random learning projects. Enjoy.
Go to the projects folder and see the readme for detailed instructions about the projects.
