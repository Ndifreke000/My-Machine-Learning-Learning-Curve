# 📘 My Machine Learning Learning Curve  

Welcome to **My-Machine-Learning-Learning-Curve** 🚀  

This repository is a collection of my personal journey in learning **Machine Learning (ML)**.  
The idea behind it was simple:  
- Go online and find old ML codebases – some unfinished because of errors, others outdated but functional.  
- Revive, update, or complete them while learning in the process.  
- Mix in code-along projects from YouTube courses and random experiments I explored on my own.  

The result? A patchwork of projects that reflect my **growth curve** as I learned, broke things, fixed them, and improved my understanding of ML step by step.

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Here  
- 🔧 **Fixed & Updated Projects** → Old codebases brought back to life.  
- 🎥 **Course Code-Alongs** → Projects I built while following YouTube tutorials.  
- 💡 **Learning Experiments** → Small personal projects for practicing concepts.  
- 🕰 **Legacy Work** → Early attempts (with all the quirks and mistakes intact).  

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists  
- To **document my journey** as I transitioned from beginner-level projects into more structured ML learning.  
- To serve as a **reference** for anyone facing similar challenges with old or broken code.  
- To remind myself (and hopefully inspire others) that **progress is not linear — it’s a curve**.

## 🚀 How to Explore  
1. Browse through the folders – each represents a different project.  
2. Check the included notes or comments inside the code for context.  
3. Feel free to clone, tinker, and learn alongside my journey:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/My-Machine-Learning-Learning-Curve.git
cd My-Machine-Learning-Learning-Curve
````

## 📚 Learning Themes Covered

* Basic ML concepts
* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Model training and evaluation
* Updating deprecated libraries to current versions
* Debugging and fixing errors in legacy code

## 📝 Final Note

This repo is not about polished production-ready ML systems.
It’s about **the process of learning, experimenting, failing, and improving**.
So if you’re learning ML too, I hope this helps you see that struggling with old, messy codebases is **part of the curve**.

Enjoy! ✨
